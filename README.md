## Introduction

Treningheten is a web-based platform for tracking workouts. A workout season is set with a start and end-date defined. Users join the season with a weekly workout goal. Then users track their workouts within the platform, showing their percentage completion of each week. If a user achieves 100% or more, a workout-streak is added to the leaderboard. The point is to motivate each other to reach a personal workout goal!
